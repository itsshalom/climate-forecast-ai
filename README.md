# 🌍 Climate Forecast AI

**Climate Forecast AI** is an open-source project that uses **AI, satellite data, and weather APIs** to generate **hyper-local climate insights** such as rainfall, drought, or flood risk predictions for smallholder farmers, MSMEs, and county governments.

---

## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to bridge the data gap in climate resilience by:
- Aggregating satellite and meteorological data from open APIs.
- Training an ML model to predict localized weather events.
- Delivering insights via mobile/web dashboards for decision-making.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow / Scikit-learn**
- **OpenMeteo API / NASA POWER API**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**
- **Flask (for web interface)**
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks**

---

## 🧠 Current Stage
- [x] Data collection and cleaning scripts.
- [x] Initial ML model for rainfall prediction.
- [ ] Visualization dashboard prototype.
- [ ] API integration for real-time data updates.

---

## 🌱 Expected Impact
Empower local communities and governments with accessible, data-driven tools for:
- Crop planning
- Disaster preparedness
- Climate resilience policy design
